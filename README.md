# Project Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of customer purchasing behaviors and store performance in the chips category. The project is aimed at understanding the factors driving chip sales, segmenting customers, and assessing the effectiveness of trial stores using statistical methods.

This project is divided into three tasks:

Customer segmentation based on purchasing patterns.
Performance comparison of trial and control stores.
Business presentation summarizing findings and recommendations.
This analysis combines data science techniques, retail analytics, and statistical testing, with practical, actionable insights for business decisions.

# Repository Contents

# Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis and Customer Insights

File: [Task 1 Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/randhirasdataanalyst/quantium-chips-analysis-task1)

Objective: Explore the dataset to uncover key insights about customer behaviors, segment sales, and brand performance.

Key Deliverables:

Customer Segmentation:
Segments customers into Budget, Mainstream, and Premium income groups across different life stages.

Identifies the major contributors to sales as older families, retirees, and young singles/couples.

Brand Performance:

Finds that Doritos is the top-performing brand, with strong sales across all customer segments.

Visualization of Sales Trends:

Visualizes sales trends by customer life-stage and product pack size, providing insights into product performance (e.g., packs of 150g, 170g, 175g show strong sales).

Recommendations:

Increase product visibility in discretionary spaces (e.g., near checkout counters) for impulse buying, especially for segments like young singles/couples.
Focus promotions around small chip packs during high-demand months (December, July, March, January).

# Task 2: Trial and Control Store Performance Evaluation

File: [Task 2 Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/randhirasdataanalyst/quantium-chips-analysis-task2)

Objective: Select control store for given trial store

Key Deliverables:

Control Store Selection:

Selected control stores (Stores 233, 155, 237) based on matching criteria to trial stores (Stores 77, 86, 88).

Visualizations:
Comparative graphs showing how sales and customer volumes differ between the trial and control stores, allowing for clear interpretation of trial effectiveness.

Recommendations:

Based on positive performance, extend the trial strategies to other stores, particularly targeting segments like mainstream young couples.
Consider replicating the trial conditions, especially around seasonal peaks.

# Task 3: Business Presentation of Key Insights

File:([Task 3 - presentation guide](https://github.com/randhir-05/QUANTIUM-VIRTUAL-INTERNSHIP/blob/8b9167b5bc32bb4f737608ace9cdf0150ee3ca2f/ALL%20TASK%20RESULTS/Task%203%20-%20presentation%20guide_BRAND.pdf))

Objective: Summarize the analytical results in a business-ready format for stakeholders, focusing on key insights, strategies, and actionable recommendations.

Key Insights:

Customer Life-Stage Segments:

Mainstream and Budget customers, particularly young singles/couples and retirees, contribute the most to sales.
Trial Store Success:

Highlighted trial store performance with a detailed comparison against control stores. Stores performing better due to higher visibility and strategic product placement.

Recommendations:

Continue targeted product promotions in areas frequented by high-value customer segments.

Explore opportunities to drive additional impulse purchases during high-traffic periods.

# Data Sources
The dataset provided includes sales data for a large supermarket chain, segmented by customer life-stage and income levels. This data is used to explore patterns in purchasing behavior and evaluate store performance. The data is de-identified and follows best practices in privacy and data security.

# Key Learnings and Insights

Segmentation-Driven Marketing: Leveraging life-stage and income-based segmentation can improve targeted marketing efforts and increase sales.

Impulse Buying Behavior: Strategic placement of small packs in high-traffic areas can significantly boost sales among younger customers.

Data-Driven Store Trials: Implementing and analyzing trial stores using control stores and statistical testing is an effective way to assess new retail strategies before a full rollout.

# Future Directions
Implement machine learning models to predict sales trends and optimize product placement further.

Extend the trial store analysis to more stores and categories to gather broader insights.

Explore the use of advanced customer segmentation techniques such as RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to uncover more granular purchasing behaviors.
